# FalconTube
A 2013 YouTube revival.

## Requirements
- A webserver with PHP (Apache or Nginx)
- Windows
- A brain

## How to use
## Currently the website is in a non-working state!
Just copy the files in /web to the root of your webserver.

With PHPMyAdmin, import the .sql file in the /sql folder.

Open the function.php file in /important and changes the username and password to the one set in MYSQL.

The homepage should have errors because there is no videos in the DB.
